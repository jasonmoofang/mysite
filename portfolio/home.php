Hello. I am Lim Yuen Hoe, and you have arrived at my online portfolio.
</p>
<p>
Here you will find a wealth of information regarding my core competencies, interests, as well as relevant
projects and endeavors that I have embarked on. At this point this place is still under construction, 
and I am still in the midst of adding content.
</p>
<p>
Still, sufficient content is already up to give a decent portrayal of my academic and technical accomplishments, so
feel free to browse around. If you're interested in a more informal side of me, you can instead pop by my website
<a href="http://yuenhoe.co.cc/">here</a>, where you can
find a more personal me, or my blog <a href="http://yuenhoe.co.cc/blog/">here</a>, where you can read about my 
geeky interests :P
</p>
<p>
If you'd like to contact me, you may do so via email (See email address on the left).

About the quote above<br />
The quote in the 'banner' above is from an old blog post of mine written right after my Junior College education, while musing
over my future. It is a reference to a quote by Archimedes, that goes something like "give me a place to stand, and I shall
move the world".
