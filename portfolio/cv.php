<h1 class="sectionHead">Skills and Experiences</h1>

<p>This is a verbose description of my (mostly technical) strengths and experiences. Feel free to request
a more standard resume from me by email if that interests you, or take a look at 
<a href="resume.pdf">this one</a> which was prepared for a Google internship application.
</p>
<br /><br /><br />
<div class="foreword"><em>Foreword</em><br />
While I have dabbled in a reasonable variety of fields, computer programming remains my primary area of interest and competency.
I enjoy working on problems that are difficult but exciting, thinking about and making various kinds of design decisions,
and care particularly about making a difference for the end user.

<h4>Thunderbird development</h4>
<p>
Developing for Open Source has been a personal goal that I have had for a while, and recently I have been able to begin
efforts towards this goal by joining the Mozilla developer community and contributing patches to Mozilla Thunderbird.
</p><p>
So far, I have completed two patches, both of which have been approved and checked into the Thunderbird source tree:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
            A trivial front-end patch for 
	    <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=471368" target="_blank">bug 471368</a> 
  </li><li>
            and an accessibility patch for 
	    <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=449560" target="_blank">bug 449560</a>
  </li>
</ul>

I am presently working on 
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=449560" target="_blank">bug 227305</a>.
Please see my <a href="index.php?page=portfolio#moz">portfolio</a> for more information on my Mozilla work.
